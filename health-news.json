One study found that 30% of Covid-19 hospitalizations were in people with obesity./nThe obesity clinic where Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford works in Boston has a 1,000-plus person wait list that grew a lot longer with the pandemic. Even with more than a dozen specialists on staff, it's not enough to meet the demand./n\"We are overwhelmed with the volume of patients that have really made that connection between obesity and Covid and the need for them to get appropriate care,\" said Cody Stanford, who is also an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.",
